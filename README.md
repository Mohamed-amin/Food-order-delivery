# Food-order-delivery
Every body once did a todo app,this my (todo-like) tiny app for learning purposes only :) 

# History
Was very new to JS and just knew the difference between arrays and objects littrals :D,
So expect a lot of wired stuff, console logs and html inside js syntax.

We used in a previous company to collect whatever delivery orders in a sheet of paper, so I thought I will make an app for that.
